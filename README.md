# AI Object Detection Web Application

Built a comprehensive web application leveraging computer vision technology to automatically detect and classify objects in uploaded images. This full-stack solution demonstrates proficiency in cloud services, API integration, and modern web development practices.

## Project Timeline
June 2025 -July 2025

## Key Features & Technologies:
- **Frontend**: Interactive web interface for seamless image upload and results visualization
- **Backend**: Node.js server handling file processing and API communications
- **AI/ML Integration**: AWS Rekognition service for advanced object detection and labeling
- **Visual Feedback**: Dynamic bounding boxes overlaying detected objects with real-time confidence scores
- **Cloud Architecture**: Scalable AWS infrastructure for reliable image processing

## Technical Implementation:
Developed the application using Node.js to create a robust server-side foundation, integrating AWS Rekognition's machine learning capabilities to analyze uploaded images. The system processes visual data to identify multiple objects simultaneously, returning precise location coordinates and confidence percentages. Results are displayed through an intuitive interface featuring color-coded bounding boxes that clearly highlight detected items.

## Impact & Applications:
This project showcases practical application of artificial intelligence in web development, demonstrating skills in API integration, cloud services, and user experience design. The solution has potential applications in inventory management, security systems, content moderation, and accessibility tools.

**Technologies Used**: Node.js, AWS Rekognition, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, RESTful APIs, Cloud Computing
